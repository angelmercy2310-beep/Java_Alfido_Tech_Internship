My Java Projects

This repository has some simple Java programs I created while learning Java. These projects helped me understand the basics of programming, object-oriented concepts, and file handling.

Projects

1. Hello World Program File:`HelloWorldModerate.java`
  Prints "Hello, World!" and a few extra messages.
Printing output, basic Java syntax, and organizing code with methods.

2. Calculator Program
 `SimpleCalculator.java
  A simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.
  Taking user input, using `switch-case`, doing arithmetic operations, and handling errors like division by zero.

3. OOP with Classes
 `OOPDemo.java`
 Shows how classes, inheritance, and method overriding work.
 Creating classes and objects, using inheritance, overriding methods, and using constructors.

4. File Reader Program
 `FileReaderDemo.java`
 Reads and shows the content of a text file.
Reading files in Java, using `BufferedReader`, and handling exceptions with `try-catch`.

 Overview
These projects helped me get comfortable with Java programming. I learned how to structure code, use object-oriented concepts, handle user input, and read files. Overall, it was a great way to practice and build a strong foundation for more advanced Java projects.
